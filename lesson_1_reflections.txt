Helped out ok, did actually expect to be a bit more intense and graphic that what it is

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
In case i need to backtrack this would help to see what progress I have made, and where I could have gone wrong

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Well at least this way you can control what changes are in the commit, and leave a description too.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because some files are related to other files and it's nice to know what simultaneosly changed in other files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log gives you the log of changes, and git diff gives you the differance inbetween the commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
knowing that i could return back to some original source code would be nice because i can program without having to worry and then go back and find out where the bug got introduced
